# SwitchEscape

This is an entirely original (including graphic) simple platformer game created with C++ and the allegro game engine.

# How to build?

This is a developement version of the project with all codes necessary to compile the main code.
The allegro library needs to be downloaded separately (available online) and liked in the compiler.
